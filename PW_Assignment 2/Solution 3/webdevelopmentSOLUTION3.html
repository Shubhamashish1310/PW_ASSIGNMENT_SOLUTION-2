  <h2>Web Development</h2>
  <p>I'm passionate about web development, and I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. On this page, I'll be writing about web development topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

    Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites. It encompasses everything from the design and layout of the website to the programming and coding that makes it work.

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It consists of four components: <br>
<ul><li><b>MongoDB: </b> A NoSQL database that is used to store data. <br></li>
<li><b>Express.js:</b> A web framework that is used to build server-side applications. <br></li>
<li><b>React.js: </b> A JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. <br></li>
<li><b>Node.js: </b>A JavaScript runtime environment that is used to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. <br></li>




</ul>
The MERN stack is a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to build a wide variety of web applications, from simple websites to complex e-commerce platforms.
