  <!-- Main content -->
  <h2>Web Design</h2>
  <p>I also love web design, and I'm always looking for new ways to create beautiful and functional websites. On this page, I'll be writing about web design topics such as typography, color theory, and layout.</p>

  <p>
    Web design is the process of creating the visual appearance of a website or web page. It encompasses everything from the layout and typography to the colors and images that are used. <br>

Web designers use a variety of tools and techniques to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Some of the most common web design tools include: <br>
<ul>
  <li><b>HTML:</b> HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is used to define the structure and content of a web page.</li>
  <li><b>CSS: </b> CSS is a style sheet language that is used to control the appearance of web pages. It is used to define the layout, typography, and colors of a web page.</li>
  <li><b>JavaScript:</b> JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. It is used to create animations, games, and other interactive elements.</li>
